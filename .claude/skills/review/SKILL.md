Review the current branch's changes against Geney project conventions before merge.

## Steps

### 1. Gather Context

Read project documentation to understand conventions:
- `CLAUDE.md` — project guide, constraints, "Do Not" rules
- `docs/PATTERNS.md` — coding conventions

### 2. Collect Changes

Get the full picture of what this branch changes:
```
git log main..HEAD --oneline
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git diff main...HEAD
```
If `main` doesn't exist, try `origin/main`.

### 3. Commit Message Audit

Check each commit message:
```
git log main..HEAD --format="%h %s"
```
Verify: short, descriptive, lowercase, imperative mood.

### 4. Code Review

Review the diff for:
- **Correctness**: Does the logic do what the commit messages claim?
- **Architecture**: Rust owns storage, Python is compute-only, IPC via Tauri invoke (no HTTP)?
- **Conventions**: Follows patterns in `docs/PATTERNS.md`? Biome style (single quotes, 2-space)? Proper type usage from `@geney/ts-geney`?
- **Error handling**: Rust uses `thiserror` + `Result<T, AppError>`? Python uses proper exceptions?
- **Security**: No credentials, injection risks, or unsafe operations?
- **Tests**: Are changes covered by tests? Are new tests needed?
- **Dead code**: Any leftover debug code, commented-out blocks, or unused imports?

### 5. Documentation Check

Review documentation for necessary updates:
- `CLAUDE.md` — Does quick reference or project structure need updating?
- `docs/PATTERNS.md` — Do any documented patterns need revision?
- `docs/SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` — Did build/test/lint commands change?
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` — Did contribution workflow change?

### 6. Skills Check

If behavior changed that affects skills in `.claude/skills/`:
- `/check` — Did build, test, or lint commands change?
- `/review` — Did review criteria or conventions change?
- `/draft` — Did PR workflow change?
- `/spawn` — Did worker spawning behavior change?
- `/issues` — Did issue tracking conventions change?

Skills must stay in sync with actual project behavior.

### 7. Issue Cross-Reference

If `issues/` has related tickets:
- Should any issue status be updated?
- Are there follow-up items to track?
